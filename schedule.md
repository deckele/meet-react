# Hands on:
—————————
1. Create an empty project + basic components: Card, Deck, Score panel, Game Board.
2. Add Game component that wraps everything and has business logic.
3. Add React-Router. Create 3 main components connected to routes: Welcome, Info, Game.
4. Add Redux. Create a store. subscribe and dispatch actions.
5. Add React-Redux. Connect the store to the project and move all BL to Redux (no react)
6. Create tests to all components
